        the method is a private method).

        The purpose of the ``_read()`` method is to perform the file read operations that are specific to the file that
        the file object represents. This method should add any supporting SQLAlchemy objects to the session without
        committing. The common ``read()`` method handles the database commit for all file objects.

        The ``read()`` method processes the user input and passes on the information through the many parameters of the
        ``_read()`` method. As the ``_read()`` method should never be called by the user directly, the arguments will
        be defined in terms of what they offer for the developer of a new file object needing to implement this method.
